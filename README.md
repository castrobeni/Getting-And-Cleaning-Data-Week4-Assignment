# Data Science Specialization - Johns Hopkins University
# Module 3: Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment

This repository contains the R script (run_analysis.R) needed to complete the week 4 assignment under the Getting and Cleaning Data module of Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization course. In summary, the purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding and to practice one's ability collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The test data used in this assignment are measurements collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The website where the data was obtained provides a full data description.

## Specific Objectives of the Project:

* Merge the test and the training data sets to create one data set
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
* Create a second and independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## Files

* 'CodeBook.md' - markdown file which provides information on the variables, the data, and the transformations employed to clean up the data

* 'run_analysis.R' - the R script which performs the tasks or objectives of the project

* 'tidy_data.txt' - the tidy data set which is the product of the R script
